Describe Power Virtual Agents
- A bot is a form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that simulates human conversation through a chat interface.
- Bots listen for keywords and phrases that relate to the library of known,
 common customer issues (topics) that are stored in the bot,
 and it will return answers quickly and iteratively as the customer continues the chat.
  The bot continues to check if the customer's question has been answered, and then refines its selection of topics to solve the customer's problem.

  Value proposition
  - Power Virtual Agents eliminates the gap between the subject matter experts and the development teams building the bots
  - long latency between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to address it
  - minimizes the IT effort required to deploy and maintain a custom conversational solution.

  Components of Power Virtual Agents
  Topics
    Topics are used to determine the general category of the conversation.
    A topic has trigger phrases, which are phrases, keywords, or questions that a user is likely to type
    that is related to a specific issue.
    Topics also have conversation nodes, which are what you use to define how a chatbot should respond and what it should do.
    2 Primary Elements
      Triggers Phrases: Represent phrases users might enter that triggers the topic
      Conversation Path:  This defines the path that is taken based on input provided by the customer
          Displaying messages
          Asking questions
          Show a message
          Call and Action
          Redirect to another topic
  Entities
    A Power Virtual Agents entity allows a chatbot to map natural language to a general subject.
    One fundamental aspect of natural language understanding is to identify entities in a user dialog.
    An entity can be viewed as an information unit that represents a certain type of a real-world subject,
      phone number,
      zip code,
      city,
       or even a person's name.
  Actions
    - You can enable your chatbot to perform an action by calling a Microsoft Power Automate flow.
    - you can use flows with end-user authentication to retrieve information about a user after they sign in.
  Publishing
    - These include live websites, mobile apps, and messaging platforms like Microsoft Teams and Facebook.
     After you have published at least once, you can connect your chatbot to additional channels.
