Intro
- Helps to digitalize business processes
- Low / no-code platform for building apps
- Great for replace paper-based / spreadsheets.
- Low technology barrier entry
- Enable front-line workers to solve their daily business problems in a very low cost experience

canvas app (Build an app from a blank canvas )
  - Is a great option to build apps designed to perform specific tasks
  - Canvas apps is that they interact with data from multiple data sources
  - App designers can easily drag and drop a variety of different controls
  - Canvas can be embedded into SharePoint sites, Power BI reports, model-driven apps or event MS Teams
  - Start choosing screensize mobile, tablet,  desktop screensize
  - Power App Studio (where we create an App)
  - App maker has control over the data sources, screen layout, overall user experience
  - reports a probelm with audio/visual equipment (Task focus)
  - Collection in a canvas app can be used to store data temporarily within the app.

Canvas apps use Power Fx formulas to control the visual elements of the screens
Canvas apps can include AI controls for form processing and object detection.



Journey to Build Canvas App
- Identify a business need that can be addressed by Power Apps.
  ** App Format (Tablet or Phone)
- Connect to any necessary data in your Power Apps.
  ** you need to connect your app to your data.
- Design the app using controls, buttons, and an easy-to-use interface.
  SCREEN
  A screen is a container for other controls.
  GALLERY
  A gallery displays rows from a table of data.you can add other controls to a gallery item, such as a link to the game location.
  FORM
  Forms are focused on working with a specific record, often based on a selection from a gallery.
  MEDIA
  Add background images, include a camara button (so users can take pictures from the app), barcode reader
  CHARTS
  Add charts so user can perform analysis
  LIST BOX
  displaying a list of values when a user needs to choose options from an available list.
  VIEW
  A view displays columns from the table but as a list.
  INPUT CONTROLS (Insert tab you can access controls)
    Text
    Inputs
    Buttons
    Dropdowns
    Toggles
    Date pickers
    Sliders
   You can add these controls to galleries, forms, and screens to build a functional and aesthetic experience for your app.
  INTELLIGENT CONTROLS
    There are hardware-backed controls which allow access to the camera, bar code scanner, GPS, and more hardware features.
  FUNCTIONS
    Functions are the glue that binds all these controls, inputs, and data sources together.
- Then your end user can interact with the data to accomplish the business need.
- Save and publish the app and test functionality.
- Once satisfied, share the app with end users to give them a better business process.


Formulas combine many elements:
  - Functions --> take parameters and perform an operation (SubmitForm works properly in presence of Button.OnSelect)
  - Signals --> return information about the env (Location returns the device's current GPS coordinates)
  - Enumeration --> pre-defined constant value like Color.Red, Color.Blue
  - Named operators --> ThisItem or Parent

model-driven app (Build from data in Microsoft Dataverse)
- app design focuses on adding components such forms, views, charts, and dashboards to tables
-they are fully responsive (browser, mobile, tablets,)
- define relationship
- define forms
- define business rules
- Process focused

Model-driven apps use role-based security to control access to the app, its features, and its data.

Data Components of the model-driven app.
Table. Logical structure of data
Column. Data type of a table
Relationship. how tables related to each other (1:N, N:1, N:N)
Choice (option has a number value and a label) Single or multiple value possible.

User Interface Component
App --> App basic info like components, properties, the url
Site Map --> specifies the navigation for your app
  Subarea in sitemap can be used to show tables/ dashboards/custom pages
  You can add multiple subareas to a group
Form --> how users see and interact with individual record.
View --> defines how list of rows of a specifc table appears in your app (Active Tickers, Today Tickets, 1-week Tickets)
        (which columns are shown, width of each column, sorting behaviour and the default filters)

Logic Components
Business Process Flow --> standarized how a company handle a specifc process
Business rule --> apply rules to hide / show & validate data as per field requirements
Flows --> automated workflows between apps and services

Visualization Components
Chart --> invidual graphical visualization in a view or form
Dashboards --> set of charts
Embedded Microsoft Power BI --> adds embedded Power BI tiles and dashboards to your app.

Is an approach that focus on adding dashboards, forms, views to your app.
Layout is determined by component you add.
Quickly viewing your business data and making decision
1. Model your business data (model driven design uses metadata driven architecture)
2. Define your business processes
3. Build the app

Building Blocks
Data --> Tables, Columns, relationship, choices
UI --> App, site Map, Forms, views
Logic --> Business Process Flows, workflows, actions, business rules, flows
Visualization --> Charts, Dashboards, Embedded Power BI

Tables are the core component when developing model-driven apps.

Add new content to an application:
- By clicking Add page button
** Table based form and view (display records in full page)
** Dashboard (display charts)
** Custom (design and build type of page, drag and drop components)

Testing the application
By selecting the Play button on the top right, the app is put into Play mode.

Power App Portals (Externally-facing websites)
Portals help you provide an organized, searchable knowledge
Portals provide simple navigation with seamless transition between self and assited support
Power Apps portals are built on top of Dataverse

Core Components of portals
Power App Portal Studio >> Webpages (instance of page template) >> Page Templates >> Content Snippets >> Entity Lists and entity forms


** Prediction model (Create a model that can predict yes or no answer based on historical data)

Security and Administration can be access admin.powerplatform.compliant
Power Apps has a set of PowerShell cmdlets for app creators, administrator and developers to automate administrative duties
