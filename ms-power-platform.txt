Data Lost prevention policies
Data loss preventions (DLP) policies act as guardrails to help prevent users to expose unintentionally organizational data
It offers the right balance between protection and productivity.
Connectors can be classified as
Business --> Connectors host business-use data
Non-Business --> Connect host personal-use data
Blocked --> Connects you want to restrict usage across one or move enviroment

Data Protection
Data in transit and within MS Datacenter are secured
Connections are encrypted, all public end points are secured using TLS.
TLS 1.2 (or higher) is requried for accessing the server endpoints.

Data loss prevention policies can be used to control the use of connectors to data and services. DLP policies allow classifying connectors as business, non-business, and blocked.
