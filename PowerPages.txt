        These widgets include text, image, video, Power BI reports, lists, forms, and others.
      Styling workspace: Used to personalize the look and feel of your site by adding styling and theming to your site.
      Data workspace: Allows you to create and modify Microsoft Dataverse tables used in data-driven web applications
        In the Data workspace, a maker can use pre-existing or new Dataverse model-driven app views to build list components.
      Set up workspace: Primary administrative area for side administration and management.
  Theme and brand your site.
    Styling offers 13 preset themes. For each theme, you can customize the color palette, background color, font styles, button styles, and section margins.

  Connect to Dataverse Data.
    When working in the Data workspace, makers can create and modify Dataverse tables directly in the Design Studio by using the Data workspace.

Scenario-based templates are complete sites that meet common needs such as registering for afterschool classes, applying for permits, and booking meetings.
 Site design templates create websites with a set of premade pages with different layouts, images, and colors.
